    <h1>JSONP Slideshow</h1>
    <p>
     In addition to writing up this tutorial on how JSONP works I also
     implemented a slideshow program in JavaScript and CSS.  I am
     fairly pleased with the results, but it could use some work.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <p>
     We need to be retrieve data from a <b>Web Service</b>
     running on a server other than the one hosting our application.
     <br>
     <br>
     We could do this with AJAX if the service
     were on our server.  (There may be a way to specify trusted servers
     on the server side. I am still looking into that).
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>Background</h1>
    In AJAX we:
    <ul>
     <li>acquire an XMLHttpRequest object from the browser
     <li>set HTTP parameters on the object
     <li>attach a callback to the object to process the returned data
     <li>invoke the send method on the object 
    </ul>
    The browser sends our request back to server the page
    was loaded from and invokes our handler when the reply
    arrives.
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>Alternatives</h1>
    People looking into ways to get around the "server of origin"
    restriction looked through the HTML elements for other objects
    that can access remote servers.  A few that can do that are:
    <ul>
     <li>img
     <li>script
     <li>frame/iframe
    </ul>
    The first two elements have a src attribute that specifies the URL 
    at which to find the resource.  Frames have other attributes that
    make them more complicated to use.
    <br>
    <br>
    We use the src attribute of script to load jQuery code from the
    Google site: <br><br>
    &lt;script src=<b>"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/...</b>" &gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
    <br><br>
    Similarly, images can be loaded from remote sites - see next slide.
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>Remote Images</h1>
    The image on this page can be found at the following URL:<br><br>
    http://www.orchidspangiafora.com/collages/corntracks.jpg    
    <br>
    <br>
    <img width="320" src="http://www.orchidspangiafora.com/collages/corntracks.jpg" alt="remote">
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>Remote Images As Code</h1>
    If instead of using the url of an image file as the value of the
    src attribute of an image element we point it at a cgi-script that
    returns an image, we can have that script take another action
    before returning the image.  This is frequently used to count
    visits to a page containing advertising hosted at a site other
    than that of the server delivering the web page.
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>JSONP</h1>
    It turns out that the script element, along with dynamic manipulation
    of the DOM in a web page, provides a way to retrieve data from
    other servers <i>provided</i> they configure things to allow it.  
    <br><br>
    This technique is know as JSONP, for <span style="color: blue;">JSON</span> 
    with <span style="color: blue;">P</span>adding.
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>JSONP on the server side</h1>
    The first thing we need from the server is the address of a service that
    will take an argument and return us some data, preferably in JSON format.
    <br>
    <br>
    For our example, www.freegeoip.net
    accepts requests for RESTful web services in the following form:
    <br>
    <br>
    http://www.freegeoip.net/json/smith.edu
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>JSONP on the server side (cont.)</h1>
    In this example, http://www.freegeoip.net/json/ is the location of
    the web service. 
    <br>
    <br>
    To tell it that the domain for which we would like geographical
    information is Smith College, we append &ldquo;smith.edu&rdquo;
    to that.
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>JSONP on the server side (cont.)</h1>
    If you visit the resulting url, <br>http://www.freegeoip.net/json/smith.edu<br><br>
    www.freegeoip.net responds with a JSON object;<br><br>
    <pre>
    {"city":         "Northampton", 
     "region_code":  "MA", 
     "region_name":  "Massachusetts", 
     "metrocode":    "543", 
     "zipcode":      "01063", 
     "longitude":    "-72.6402", 
     "country_name": "United States", 
     "country_code": "US", 
     "ip":           "131.229.64.19", 
     "latitude":     "42.3179"}
    </pre>
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>JSONP on the server side<span style="font-size: smaller;">(end part 1)</span></h1>
    So far so good.  But how can we get that data into our JavaScript
    program in the browser over on the client side?
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>JSONP on the client</h1>
    If we dynamically create a script object and attach it to the our
    web page it will be run as a javascript program as soon as it is
    complete.<br><br>

    Clicking the button will cause the following script to be loaded
    into this page.      <br>
    <br>
    <pre>
        &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
            alert('Thank you')
        &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
    <button id="loadscript">Try it</button>
    <br>
    This does <b><i>NOT</i></b> add a handler that directly puts up a
    message when the button is pressed.  The button's action is to
    modify the page by adding a script.
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>JSONP on the client (cont.)</h1>
    So if were to use the same method to attach this script to the page:
    <pre>
        &lt;script type="text/javascript src="http://www.freegeoip.net/json/smith.edu"&gt;
        &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
    It would cause the browser to attempt to interpret the return value, 
    <pre>
    {"city":         "Northampton", 
     "region_code":  "MA", 
     (and so forth)...
     "latitude":     "42.3179"}
    </pre>
    as JavaScript.  Unfortunately, that doesn't get us anywhere,
    because JSON defines an object, but that object is not executable
    and we have no way to refer to it.  
    <span style="color: blue;">Here is where JSONP comes in.</span> 
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>Back to the server</h1>
    In order to support JSONP requests, server programs allow their
    web service URLS to be parameterized with a little bit of extra
    information.  In the case of the Freegeoip API (application
    programming interface) the parameter that the server looks for is named <b>"callback"</b>.
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>How a JSONP service handles the extra parameter</h1>
    If instead of:<br><br>    
    <b>http://www.freegeoip.net/json/smith.edu</b><br><br>
    we visit<br><br>    
    http://www.freegeoip.net/json/smith.edu<b>?callback=getGeoInfo</b>
    <br><br> 
    Rather than simply sending us JSON data, the server replies with:
    <br><br>    
    <pre>
     getGeoInfo({"city": "Northampton", "region_code": "MA", 
                 "region_name": "Massachusetts", "metrocode": "543", 
                 "zipcode": "01063", "longitude": "-72.6402", 
                 "country_name": "United States", 
                 "country_code": "US", 
                 "ip": "131.229.64.19", 
                 "latitude": "42.3179"});
    </pre>
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>Back to the client</h1>
    So when the client evaluates the returned data as code:
    <pre>
     getGeoInfo({"city": "Northampton", "region_code": "MA", 
                 "region_name": "Massachusetts", "metrocode": "543", 
                 "zipcode": "01063", "longitude": "-72.6402", 
                 "country_name": "United States", 
                 "country_code": "US", 
                 "ip": "131.229.64.19", 
                 "latitude": "42.3179"});
    </pre>
    it invokes a function named getGeoInfo.  We defined that function,
    which is why we passed its name as a parameter to the web service
    url.  So our method is invoked with the JSON data passed in as the
    parameter, and we have what we wanted.
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h1>What does jQuery do?</h1>
    jQuery makes things a little simpler for us, and a little cleaner.  When we call 
    jQuery.getJSON, jQuery:
    <ol>
     <li>Invents a unique name for the handler passed to the server
     <li>Constructs the script to invoke the hander we specified by way of the function it generated
     <li>Adds the script to the page
     <li>Invokes our function with the results
     <li>Removes the script from the page
    </ol>
   </div>
   <div class="slide">
    <h1>End</h1>
